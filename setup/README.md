# Use of the virtual machine
When you start the virtual machine with VMWare or VirtualBox, a window with Linux running will pop up. On the desktop, you will find a ROS terminal link on which ROS2 and Gazebo are installed. Note that opening the terminal with the shortcut Ctrl + alt + T will open a terminal that DO NOT have ROS2 and Gazebo installed.
