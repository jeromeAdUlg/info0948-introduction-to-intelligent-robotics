# Use of the virtual machine
When you start the virtual machine with VMWare or VirtualBox, a window with Linux running will pop up. On the desktop, you will find many shortcuts. One of them is called **ROS2 foxy terminal**. This shortcut will open a terminal with ROS2 foxy and Gazebo installed. Note that opening the terminal with the shortcut Ctrl + alt + T will open a terminal that DO NOT have ROS2 and Gazebo installed. The other shortcuts won't be usefull for this course.
