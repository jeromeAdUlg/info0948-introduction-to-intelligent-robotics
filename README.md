# INFO0948 - Introduction to intelligent robotics

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the course "INFO0948-1 - Introduction to Intelligent Robotics"! This repository serves as a central hub for resources and information related to the course. From lecture slides to assignments, and all the way to the project guidelines, you will find everything here. We encourage collaboration and open communication, so don't hesitate to raise issues and contribute to discussions on the [Edstem forum](https://edstem.org/) dedicated to this course.

### Lectures

The lectures will give you an introduction to various topics of the field of robotics. They will provide you with a good understanding of important concepts such as robot kinematics, sensor interpretation, or control and planning methods. We try to make the lectures as problem-oriented as possible, meaning we will cover theoretical concepts through fundamental problems of robotics like mapping, localization, environment perception and SLAM. Even though they are not mandatory, the theoretical lectures serve as a vital knowledge foundation that will help you with the homework and the project.

The lecture slides and schedule are available in the 'lectures' folder.

### Tutorials and homework

Several tutorials will be organized throughout the semester. Those sessions will allow you to put the concepts taught during the lectures into practice. Most of tutorials will be under the form of a Jupyter notebook using Python. For a good Python tutorial, see the [Github page](https://github.com/glouppe/info8006-introduction-to-ai/tree/master/python-tutorial) of Professor Gilles Louppes and his INFO8006 team. Before each tutoring session, we'll ask you to complete the homework provided the previous week. The aim of this homework is to refresh your memory on the subject covered, so that you can get the most out of the session. 

The content related to tutorials and homework can be found in the 'tutorials' folder.

### Project

The project is the part of the course that requires the most efforts. Your final grade will be almost entirely based on this work. By group of three students, you will have access to a Turtlebot and to a computer with the  softwares required to control the robot already installed. Note those robots and computers can't leave the laboratory, so you will be constrained to test your code there.

The guidelines and all other usefull pieces of information about the project are gathered in the 'project' folder.

### Setup

In this course, you will have to work with [ROS2 Foxy](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html) and a simulation environment called [Gazebo](https://docs.ros.org/en/foxy/index.html). The Foxy version of ROS2 requires Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa. The 'setup' folder will guide you through the installations of a virtual machine Ubuntu 20.04, ROS2 and Gazebo.
